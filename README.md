> This year I am trying to learn GO. Haven't tried GO before so the solutions might be not the most elegant ever :D

## Day 1

Haha, this took me much longer than I anticipated. I have forgotten a lot of the CS basics and had to research how to do the quick sort and how to do binary search (even though I didn't even use it in the end)

- I have learned how to read file in GO
- I have practiced some array/slices, conversions, maps and other basics
- I have revisited and implemented QuickSort and LinearSearch

## Day 2

Today it was pretty easy. I got stuck for a while because I didn't notice one condition for unsafe report (the equal levels). Then I was unsure about the for loop skipping in go but that was easy to figure out. The solution could most likely be cleaner, I went with pretty verbose if "early returns" but I like that it's more specific even if it's less concise.

- Revisited the file reading, string -> int conversions, abs values...
